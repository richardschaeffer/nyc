Assumptions:

For example, “The cow jumped over the moon.” should return 6 and “jumped”.

	This requirement is ambiguous because it doesn't describe the data type of the return value.  
	
	I am assuming that "return" does not explicitly mean return both of these as values
	in the return statement, either as an object with these properties or some other way 
	of returning both values simultaneously.  In this case, I am just printing them to output
	for ease since they are already properties of a declared Sentence object.  
	
	If this was the intended behavior, I included a second method (getAttributesString) 
	to return them both as a combined string.  It could also be returned as a structure
	containing both values but I don't think that was the intended requirement.  
	
Create unit tests to test that method, reworking your code if needed.
	
	A specific framework was not indicated, just used jUnit.
